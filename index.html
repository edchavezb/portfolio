        <p class="top-paragraph">Hello! My name is Edgar and I am 26 years old. I was born in Mexico City. I am a curious and motivated person who loves exploring the opportunities that recent innovations are bringing to our lives. I am fascinated by all things tech and I am also interested in helping make more sustainable cities with better mobility. I currently work at Taxify, taking care of improving the experience of users across Mexico and multiple cities in Africa.</p>
        <p>When it comes to my personal life, I like to spend time writing and recording music. I consider myself a bit of a music nerd as I love to keep track of new album releases and I can spend hours making playlists on Spotify. I also enjoy discovering new food places in the city and trying things I have not eaten before. I love mexican food and I don't believe life is possible without tacos or mole.</p>
